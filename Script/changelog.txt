Shoutout: TheLastWitcher for original modPS4Icons

CHANGELOG:
-- v2.20 --
Added: Witcher 3 v1.31 support

-- v2.10 --
Thanks a lot CDPR for suddenly redoing all the InputManager stuff after I spent hours figuring the old method out...
You managed to do a decent initial job this time around for switching between Xbox, PS4, and Steam controller on PC,
but you missed many use cases and corner cases causing many bugs of wrong icons showing!

Added: Witcher 3 v1.22 support
Added: Many, many, many CDPR controller/gamepad switching bugs fixed

-- v2.00 --
Completely trashed the old approach of trying to modify redswf files. That approach had significant limitations.
Improved: PS4 icons supported everywhere!
Added: PS4 controller shown in "Controller Scheme" options menu!
